You may either not be interested in population genetics at all, or not willing to run the full pipeline on your project. If you are still eager to leverage the Targeted Learning framework, you can either rely on:

- [TMLE.jl](https://targene.github.io/TMLE.jl/stable/): A Julia package for Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE).
- [TmleCLI.jl](https://github.com/TARGENE/TmleCLI.jl): A command line interface to run TMLE on your data.
