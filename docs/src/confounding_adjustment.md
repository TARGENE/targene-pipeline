# Adjusting for confounders

To account for potential confounding effect due to population stratification, we extract principal components from the genetic data using [flashpca](https://github.com/gabraham/flashpca). We follow the recommended procedure for this tool which implies some preprocessing and filtering. The associated arguments are as follows:

- `LD_BLOCKS` (optional): A path to pre-identified linkage desequlibrium blocks around the variants that will be queried for causal effect estimation. Those LD blocks will be removed from the data.
- `FLASHPCA_EXCLUSION_REGIONS` (required, default: [data/exclusion_regions_hg19.txt](https://github.com/TARGENE/targene-pipeline/data/exclusion_regions_hg19.txt)): A path to the flashpca special exclusion regions which is provided in [their repository](https://github.com/gabraham/flashpca/blob/master/exclusion_regions_hg19.txt).
- `MAF_THRESHOLD` (optional, default: 0.01): Only variants with that minor allele frequency are used to compute principal components.
- `NB_PCS` (optional, default: 6): The number of PCA components to extract.
