# Specifying a Targeted Estimator

The estimator configuration file describes the TMLE specification for the estimation of the parameters defined in the previous section. In order to provide maximum flexibility, this is provided as a plain [Julia](https://julialang.org/) file via the `ESTIMATORFILE` parameter.

The content of this file is fully described [here](https://targene.github.io/TargetedEstimation.jl/stable/estimatorfile/) and available models listed [here](https://targene.github.io/TargetedEstimation.jl/stable/models/).
