Typically, multiple sets of variants are of interest and each set is identified with a specific molecule, contributing to the mechanism. In particular, it is assumed that a set of variants, usually binding quantitative trait loci (bQTLs) play a pivotal role because they can be precisely located in the genome and don't suffer from linkage disequilibrium. All interactions of interest are thus defined with respect to that set of genetic variations. Let's Consider the following scenario: we know that a transcription factor binds to molecules x and y and then differentially binds to specific regions in the genome (bQTLs) to regulate downstream genes. We suspect that an alteration of this mechanism is responsible for some diseases. A set of xQTLs, associated with the expression of x and a set of yQTLs associated with the expression of y have been identified. Together xQTLs and yQTLs variants are termed \"trans actors\". We further suspect that some environmental factors may influence this process. From that scenario, there are many questions that can be asked, for instance : \"What is the interaction effects of a bQTL with an environmental factor?\". This is a simple pairwise interaction setting and more complex scenarios can be envisaged as described in the following graph.","category":"page"},{"location":"parameter_specification/","page":"Parameter plans","title":"Parameter plans","text":"<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<img src=\"assets/from_actors.png\" alt=\"FromActors\" style=\"width:800px;\"/>\n</div>","category":"page"},{"location":"parameter_specification/","page":"Parameter plans","title":"Parameter plans","text":"Let us now turn to the pipeline specification for this parameter plan:","category":"page"},{"location":"parameter_specification/","page":"Parameter plans","title":"Parameter plans","text":"BQTLS: A path to a .csv file containing at least an ID column for each rsID and an optional CHR column for the chromosome on which the SNP is located.\nTRANS_ACTORS: A path prefix to a set of .csv files identifying different trans-acting variants.
