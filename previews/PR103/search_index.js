Typically, multiple sets of variants are of interest and each set is identified with a specific molecule, contributing to the mechanism. In particular, it is assumed that a set of variants, usually binding quantitative trait loci (bQTLs) play a pivotal role. All interactions of interest are thus defined with respect to that set of genetic variations. Let's Consider the following scenario: we know that a transcription factor binds to molecules x and y and then differentially binds to specific regions in the genome (bQTLs) to regulate downstream genes. We suspect that an alteration of this mechanism is responsible for some diseases. A set of xQTLs, associated with the expression of x and a set of yQTLs associated with the expression of y have been identified. Together xQTLs and yQTLs variants are termed \"trans actors\". We further suspect that some environmental factors may influence this process. From that scenario, there are many questions that can be asked, for instance : \"What is the interaction effects of a bQTL with an environmental factor?\". This is a simple pairwise interaction setting and more complex scenarios can be envisaged as described in the following graph.","category":"page"},{"location":"parameter_specification/","page":"Describing the causal parameters of interest","title":"Describing the causal parameters of interest","text":"<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<img src=\"../assets/from_actors.png\" alt=\"FromActors\" style=\"width:600px;\"/>\n</div>","category":"page"},{"location":"parameter_specification/","page":"Describing the causal parameters of interest","title":"Describing the causal parameters of interest","text":"Let us now turn to the pipeline specification for this parameter plan:","category":"page"},{"location":"parameter_specification/","page":"Describing the causal parameters of interest","title":"Describing the causal parameters of interest","text":"BQTLS: A path to a .csv file containing at least an ID column for each rsID and an optional CHR column for the chromosome on which the SNP is located.\nTRANS_ACTORS: A path prefix to a set of .csv files identifying different trans-acting variants.

(independent and identically distributed) hypothesis is not satisfied, most of the traditional statistical inference theory falls apart. This is typically possible in population genetics where a study may contain related individuals. Here we leverage a non-parametric method called Sieve Variance Plateau (SVP) estimation. The hypothesis is that the dependence between individuals is sufficiently small, so that our targeted estimator will still be asymptotically unbiased, but its variance will be under estimated. In brief, the SVP estimator computes a variance estimate for a range of thresholds 𝜏, by considering individuals to be genetically independent if their genetic distance exceeds 𝜏. The genetic distance between a pair of individuals (𝑖, 𝑗) equals 1 − GRM𝑖,𝑗 , i.e., one minus their genetic relatedness value. As the distance threshold 𝜏 increases, fewer individuals are assumed to be genetically independent. For instance, the estimate corresponding to a distance of 𝜏 = 0 corresponds to the i.i.d. hypothesis, while a distance of 𝜏 = 1 incorporates pairs of individuals who are not genetically correlated. TarGene varies the threshold 𝜏 from 0 to 1 and fits a curve to the corresponding variance estimates. The maximum of this curve is the most conservative estimate of the variance of the target parameter estimator and constitutes our corrected variance estimator.","category":"page"},{"location":"sieve_variance/","page":"Correcting for population relatedness","title":"Correcting for population relatedness","text":"The following arguments can be changed to control the behaviour of the pipeline:","category":"page"},{"location":"sieve_variance/","page":"Correcting for population relatedness","title":"Correcting for population relatedness","text":"GRM_NSPLITS (default: 100): This is a purely computational argument.

For instance, the \"Alcohol intake frequency.\" is simply the value from the \"1558-0.0\" column.\nOrdinal data: Some variables are encoded as categorical by the UK-Biobank but an ordinal interpretation seems more appropriate. A list of such variables has been identified and hard-coded. They will be treated like continuous variables.\nCategorical variables: For those variables again, the first visit assessment value for the specified field is used. An additional codings field can be provided. In that case the variable is turned into a indicator variable indicating whether an individual is included in the criterion given by the codings list. In the previous subset section, \"White\" is such a transformation into a binary variable. Note that we could add more elements to the list to subset on a wider population.\nCategorical Arrayed variables: Some fields in the UK-Biobank consist in list of traits for individuals. This is the case for at least the fields: 41202, 41204, 20002 and 40006. For those fields it is essential to define a codings section that describes a trait. For instance \"Malignant melanoma of skin\" corresponds to the declaration of any of the codings for an individual. Moreover, some fields share the same encoding, this is the case for  41202 and 41204. In that situation it may be useful to aggregate those sources of information. For that purpose multiple fields can be provided to the fields section. In that scenario the declaration of any of the coding in a codings section for any of the fields will define the trait.","category":"page"},{"location":"data_sources/","page":"Setting a data source","title":"Setting a data source","text":"To come back to the pipeline specification, if a \"typical\" main dataset has already been decrypted outside of the pipeline, one may use the DECRYPTED_DATASET as an input to the pipeline instead of the ENCRYPTED_DATASET and ENCODING_FILE arguments.
